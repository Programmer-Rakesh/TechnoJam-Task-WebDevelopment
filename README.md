# Technojam-Task-webDevelopment

1.  I began with the easy task:
    First, I added a picture and then, with the help of the span tag, I wrote two lines on it. Then I created a direct link button, which opens in a new tab (basically for providing more detailed information about the F-35). After that, I started working on the styling, and lastly, I focused on making it responsive (Dimensions: iPad Air).
    I have been learning web development since the 4th of October. So I only know the basics of HTML and CSS. With that knowledge, I created one project on my own (Self_MadePROJECT_1). I didn’t work on making it responsive because I made it recently, and for now, as a beginner, it can be challenging to make it responsive.


  2. To be honest, I didn’t face any challenges in creating the card, as it was just a basic one. But I will keep adding complexity to my projects.


  3. My name is Rakesh Roy. I’m from the northern part of West Bengal—Siliguri, under the Darjeeling district. I’m from a military background, so I have traveled across India and enjoyed different cultures. Seeing army aviation and vehicles, I developed an interest in fighter jets. Apart from that,I am very fascinated by aerospace technologies, mechatronics, and robotics. Though I don’t have detailed knowledge in these fields yet, I’m eagerly waiting to seize every opportunity to learn more about them. I also have an elder cousin brother who recently got placed as a front-end developer. Inspired by him, I started learning web development. My goal is to master every software and language used in web development. Thank you 🙏
